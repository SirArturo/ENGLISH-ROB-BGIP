LED	Lights
The	idea	behind	the	application	has	a	slight	geophysical	background	or	
could	be	used	in	this	context.	The	goal	was	to	use	the	LED	strip,	for	
example,	to	categorize	the	strength	of	earthquakes	and	to	arrange	their	
strength	by	order.	This	means	that	you	assign	colors	for	different	strengths.	
So	there	are	12	categories	for	our	three	colors.	The	color	green	includes	the	
categories	one	to	four,	which	range	from	- category	1	"The	earthquake	is	
not	noticeable"	to	category	4	"The	earthquake	is	noticeable".	Categories	five	
to	eight	are	represented	by	the	color	yellow.	The	area	for	these	categories	
ranges	from	"strongly	noticeable	by	most	people"	to	"building	damage	-
slight	damage	occurs".	The	color	red,	which	also	generally	stands	for	
danger,	covers	the	last	categories	9	to	12.	This	area	starts	with	"serious	
building	damage"	to	"complete	devastation".	Definitely,	an	improvement	
would	still	be	possible,	since	there	are	sometimes	large	differences	between	
the	individual	earthquake	categories.	(For	example,	a	category	two	
earthquake	is	33	times	stronger	than	a	category	one.)	However,	the	
application	provides	a	specific	direction	to	distinguish	earthquakes	
between:
• non-dangerous,	weak,	[green]
• Noticeable,	potentially	dangerous,	[yellow]
• strong/very	strong,	life-threatening.	[red]
